        <p>I am an electrical engineer, mother, and wife. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering in
            2010 from the
            University of São Paulo (USP). I have professional experience in the development of electric motors for
            refrigeration
            systems, where I worked on research and product engineering. I am currently studying Software Development
            and Web Design
            at BYU–Idaho to expand my technical skills and transition into the technology field.</p>
